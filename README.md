# Fluent Python Code Snippets

This repository contains code I am writing whilst going through Luciano Ramalho's "Fluent Python" book.

## Part 1. Prologue

### 1. The Python Data Model

- `french_deck.py` a Python class representing a french deck of cards, highlighting the power of Python.
- `vector.py` a Python class representing a vector, implementation of special methods.

## Part 2. Data Structures

### 2. An Array of Sequences

- `listcomps.py` a Python code snippet used to visualise list comprehension in Python.
- `gen_exps.py` a Python code snippet showing how to use generator expressions.
- `tuples_lists.py` a Python code snippet demonstrating the uses of tuples and lists in Python.
- `arrays_queues.py` a Python code snippet demonstrating when to use arrays and queues, and why in Python.

### 3. Dictionaries and Sets

- `dictionaries.py` a Python code snipper used to show some of the features of dictionaries in Python.
- `sets.py` a Python code snippet to show some of the features of the widely under used set type.

### 4. Text vs. Bytes

- `text_vs_bytes.py` a Python code snippet to show the difference between text and bytes in Python.

## Part 3. Functions as Objects

### 5. First-Class Functions

- `functions.py` a Python code snippet to show Python treating functions as objects, everything in Python is an object.
