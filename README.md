# Fluent Python Code Snippets

This repository contains code I am writing whilst going through Luciano Ramalho's "Fluent Python" book.

## Part 1. Prologue

### 1. The Python Data Model

- `french_deck.py` a Python class representing a french deck of cards, highlighting the power of Python.
- `vector.py` a Python class representing a vector, implementation of special methods.

## Part 2. Data Structures

### 2. An Array of Sequences

- `listcomps.py` a Python code snippet used to visualise list comprehension in Python.
- `gen_exps.py` a Python code snippet showing how to use generator expressions.
- `tuples_lists.py` a Python code snippet demonstrating the uses of tuples and lists in Python.
- `arrays_queues.py` a Python code snippet demonstrating when to use arrays and queues, and why in Python.

### 3. Dictionaries and Sets

- `dictionaries.py` a Python code snipper used to show some of the features of dictionaries in Python.
- `sets.py` a Python code snippet to show some of the features of the widely under used set type.

### 4. Text vs. Bytes

- `text_vs_bytes.py` a Python code snippet to show the difference between text and bytes in Python.

## Part 3. Functions as Objects

### 5. First-Class Functions

- `functions.py` a Python code snippet to show Python treating functions as objects, everything in Python is an object.

### 6. Design Patterns with First-Class Functions

- `design_patterns.py` a Python code snippet showing the design patters which can be used with first-class functions in Python.
- `design_patterns_2.py` a Python code snippet showing the design patters which can be used with first-class functions in Python.

### 7. Function Decorators and Closures

- `decorators_101.py` a Python code snippet showing the behaviour and usefulness of decorators in the Python language.
- `clockdeco_demo.py` a Python code snippet shwoing an example of a decorator function in action.
- `clockdeco2.py` a Python code snipper showing another default library decorator in action.

## Part 4. Object-Oriented Idioms

### 8. Object References, Mutability, and Recycling

- `obj_ref_mut_recy.py` a Python code snippet showing some of the contents covered in this chapter.

### 9. A Pythonic Object

- `vector2d_v0.py` a Python class detailing Python objects using coded examples.
- `private_protected.py` a Python code snippet showing protected and private variables in Python.
